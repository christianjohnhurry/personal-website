                <p>Hello my name is Christian Hurry, this is my personal website!</p>
                <p>I'm a theoretical physicist by training. Machine learning engineer in biotech by trade. Improvisational comedian by night. Guitar player always. </p>
                <p> I hold a PhD in Applied Mathematics from King's College London, specialising in the physics of disordered and complex systems. Broadly speaking, these are systems 
                    comprised of many individual components, that each interact with a seemingly random subset of the system. Complex systems are known for displaying
                complex system wide behaviour, even when the dynamics of each individual is quite simple. </p>
                <p>The background of this webpage is Conway's Game of Life, a 
                    famous example of a cellular automaton, mimicking evolution.</p>

                <h2>The Game of Life</h2>
                <p>
                    The Game of Life works as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The cellular automaton is defined by a grid of cells 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each cell is either alive (=1) or dead (=0)
                        </li>
                        <li>Underpopulation - cell with less than 2 neighbours dies </li>
                        <li>Living - cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours lives on </li>
                        <li>Overpopulation - Cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies </li>
                        <li>Reproduction - a dead cell with 3 or 6 neighbours becomes alive </li>
                    </ul>
                    When the website is first loaded, we flip a weighted coin with a 30% chance of landing on heads
                    for every cell in the grid. If it lands on heads, the cell is set to <i>alive</i>. As you scroll
                    down the webpage, we follow the above rules, and update the grid to reflect the changes in the population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have included a button to reset the game - but the cells are initialised with the same weighted coin, 
                    and the chance of you finding the same initialisation are essentially zero. You will see how with each press of the 
                    button, the population changes in ways that look different each time. 
                </p>
