                <p>Hello my name is Christian Hurry, this is my personal website!</p>
                <p>I'm a theoretical physicist by training. Machine learning engineer in biotech by trade. Improvisational comedian by night. Guitar player always. </p>
                <p> I hold a PhD in Applied Mathematics from King's College London, specialising in the physics of disordered and complex systems. Broadly speaking, these are systems 
                    comprised of many individual components, that each interact with a seemingly random subset of the system. Complex systems are known for displaying
                complex system wide behaviour, even when the dynamics of each individual is quite simple. </p>
                <p>My PhD focussed on deriving equations that describe such systems including: the dynamics of cells in the immune response to cancer, 
                    the spread of epidemics in human populations, and gene regulatory networks that govern the dynamics of cells.

                <h2>The Game of Life</h2>
                <p>The background of this webpage is Conway's Game of Life, a 
                    famous example of a cellular automaton, mimicking evolution. 
                This toy model demonstrates how many individuals following simple rules, lead to unexpected behaviour.</p>
                <p>
                    The Game of Life works as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The cellular automaton is defined by a grid of cells 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each cell is either alive (=1) or dead (=0)
                        </li>
                        <li>Cells with less than 2 neighbours dies - <i>underpopulation</i> </li>
                        <li>Cells with 2 or 3 live neighbours live on - <i>survival</i></li>
                        <li>Cells with more than 3 live neighbours die - <i>overpopulation</i></li>
                        <li>A dead cell with 3 or 6 neighbours becomes alive - <i>reproduction</i> </li>
                    </ul>

                <section id="gol2">
                    <p>When the website is first loaded, each cell is given a 30% chance to start off in the alive state. </p> 
                    <p>As you scroll down the webpage, we take the current state of the grid, and apply the above rules to compute a new grid of cells.
                       We replace the old grid with the new one, reflecting the change in the population.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    I have included a button to reset the game - the 
                    chance of you landing on the same configuration as before are practically <i>zero</i>. Press it a few times, and then 
                    scroll around, to see the unpredictable dynamics that just 4 simple rules leads to.

                <p> If 4 simple rules cause all this chaos, what happens when the rules look a little more realistic?</p>

                <p>How does the universe get anything done?! </p> 
                <p>There are answers to these questions.</p>
